\usage{
rank_factors_est(
  X,
  proj_N = 30,
  r_range = NULL,
  C_range = seq(0, 100, 0.1)[-1],
  M0 = 200,
  M = 5,
  B = 50,
  input_r = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A 'Tensor' object defined in package \pkg{rTensor} with \eqn{K+1} modes. Mode-1 should correspond to the time mode.}

\item{proj_N}{Number of iterations for iterative projection. Default is 30.}

\item{r_range}{Approximate range of \eqn{r_k} (number of factors) to search from, written in a list of \eqn{K} vectors (e.g. \code{z = list(c(1,10),c(1,10))} for \eqn{K = 2}). Default range is 1 to 10 for all modes.}

\item{C_range}{The range of constant C for calculating threshold. Default is \code{seq(0,100,0.1)}.}

\item{M0}{Number of random samples to generate in pre-averaging procedure. Usually set as 200, or \eqn{min(d_{-k}^2 /4, 1000)} for potential more samples. Default is 200.}

\item{M}{Number of chosen samples for pre-averaging. Usually can be set as constants (5 or 10) or 2.5 percents of \code{M0}. Default is 5.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap samples for estimating rank of core tensor by bootstrapped correlation thresholding. Default is 50.}

\item{input_r}{The rank of core tensor if it is already know, written as a vector of length \eqn{K}. If no input, it will be estimated. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following: \cr
    \code{rank}: A vector of \eqn{K} elements, indicating the estimated number of factors in each mode \cr
    \code{loadings}: A list of \eqn{K} estimated factor loading matrices.
}
\description{
The complete procedure to estimate both rank and factor loading matrices simultaneously.
}
\details{
Input a tensor time series and return the estimated factor loading matrices and rank of core tensor.
