## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted the redundant "Tools for" at the start of title.

* Used the Authors@R field and declare Maintainer, Authors and Contributors with their appropriate roles with person() calls.

* Written package names, software names and API (application programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description.

* Avoided using "T" or "F" as vector names in 'tensor_data_gen'.

* Unwrapped small examples if they are executable in < 5 sec, and replacing dontrun{} with \donttest{}.

* Updated examples in 'tensor_data_gen' to avoid messages on the console that cannot be easily suppresed.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
