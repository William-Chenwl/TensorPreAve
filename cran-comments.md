This is a new version of the package. In this version I have:

Updated functions 'tensor_data_gen', 'pre_est', 'iter_proj', 'bs_cor_rank' and 'rank_factors_est' to accommodate updated assumptions and estimation procedures in the revised paper 'Rank and Factor Loadings Estimation in Time Series Tensor Factor Model by Pre-averaging'. 

Added a function 'pre_eigenplot' to assist users tune certain parameter in 'pre_est'.

Updated vignettes and examples accordingly.
